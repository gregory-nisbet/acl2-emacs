This is a self-contained .emacs file for working with ACL2.

It is derived from the sources of ACL2 itself, which are licensed under a permissive license similar to the
BSD license. This permits me to combine them and make some of my own changes and license the result under the
GPLv3+. Note though that I am only the copyright holder for a very small part, possibly nothing depending on
how many or few changes I make.
